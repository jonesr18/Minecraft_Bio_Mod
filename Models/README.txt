In this folder, we will store the models, textures and all related files for the mod. 
Final textures are also placed in the appropriate mod block/item folder.

I (Ross) will be using the free image editor GIMP to make textures.

*_model: A model file from Techne

*_raw: A raw file used as a base for a texture

*_reduced: A file cropped and resized to 16x16 px for use in making the texture layout

*_layout: An .xcf (GIMP) file for editing (it is better to open and use this file than to import an image file)
--> Note: if you use some other editor, use the same name for the editor's file format even with the different extension.

*_final: The final PNG file used in the mod - copy should exist in the mod block/item folders
